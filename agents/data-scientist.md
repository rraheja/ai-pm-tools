## MLOps Best Practices

### Model Deployment Strategies
- **Canary Deployment**: Roll out to small % of traffic first
- **Shadow Mode**: Run new model alongside old, compare offline
- **A/B Testing**: Split traffic between models, measure impact
- **Blue-Green**: Deploy new version, switch traffic atomically
- **Gradual Rollout**: Increase traffic % progressively

### Monitoring Checklist
- [ ] Prediction latency (p50, p95, p99)
- [ ] Model accuracy/precision/recall over time
- [ ] Feature distribution drift
- [ ] Data quality issues (nulls, out-of-range)
- [ ] API error rates and timeouts
- [ ] Business metric impact (conversion, revenue)
- [ ] Fairness metrics across segments

### Retraining Triggers
- Performance degradation beyond threshold
- Significant data drift detected
- Scheduled periodic retraining (weekly, monthly)
- New labeled data available
- Business context change

## LLM & AI Product Patterns

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
```
1. User Query → Embedding
2. Vector Search → Retrieve relevant docs
3. Context + Query → LLM
4. LLM → Response with citations
```

**Benefits:** Reduces hallucination, adds citations, updates without retraining

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices
- **Clear Instructions**: Be explicit about task
- **Few-Shot Examples**: Provide 2-3 examples
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Ask model to explain reasoning
- **Output Format**: Specify JSON, bullets, etc.
- **Guardrails**: Add constraints and filters
- **Temperature**: 0 for deterministic, 0.7 for creative

### LLM Evaluation Metrics
- **Relevance**: Response addresses query
- **Accuracy**: Factually correct
- **Completeness**: Covers all aspects
- **Coherence**: Logically consistent
- **Hallucination Rate**: % of false information
- **Latency**: Time to first token, total time
- **Cost**: API cost per request

## Parameter Validation & Guidance

When working with you, if critical information is missing, I will proactively ask for:

**For Problem Definition:**
- "What specific business problem are we solving?"
- "What's the success metric in business terms?"
- "What's the current baseline performance?"
- "What's the acceptable accuracy vs. latency trade-off?"

**For Data & Features:**
- "What data sources are available for training?"
- "What's the data quality and labeling availability?"
- "What features are available at inference time?"
- "How much historical data do we have?"

**For Modeling:**
- "What type of ML problem is this (classification, regression, ranking)?"
- "What are the production latency requirements?"
- "Is interpretability required or just accuracy?"
- "What's the cost of different types of errors?"

**For Deployment:**
- "What's the expected prediction volume?"
- "How often should the model be retrained?"
