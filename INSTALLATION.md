## Method 3: Manual Installation (Web Claude)

### For Claude Web Users

1. **Download the Repository**
   - Go to https://github.com/rraheja/ai-pm-tools
   - Click "Code" â†’ "Download ZIP"
   - Extract to a local folder

2. **Upload Agents and Skills to Projects**
   Since web Claude doesn't support local plugins, you can:
   
   **Option A: Add to a Claude Project**
   - Create a new Claude Project
   - Name it "AI PM Tools"
   - In Project Knowledge, upload:
     - All agent files from `/agents/` folder
     - Skill files from `/skills/ai-usecase-prioritization/`
     - Select command files you'll use frequently from `/commands/`

   **Option B: Reference in Conversation**
   - Upload agent and skill files at the start of each conversation
   - Example:
     ```
     [Upload agile-coach.md and agile-ceremonies SKILL.md]
     
     Claude, please act as the Agile Coach Agent and use the 
     agile-ceremonies skill to help me create a team charter.
     ```

3. **Using Commands in Web**
   Commands work differently in web:
   - You won't have `/command` syntax
   - Instead, reference the command file:
     ```
     [Upload create-team-charter.md]
     
     Claude, please follow the create-team-charter command structure 
     to help me build a charter for my new team.
     ```

## Post-Installation Setup

### Recommended Configuration

1. **Set Up File Permissions** (Desktop App Only)
   - Grant Claude access to a working directory for documents
   - Recommended: `~/Documents/Claude-Workspace/`
   - This allows Claude to save generated files directly

2. **Configure Skills Folder** (Optional)
   If you want to add more skills later:
   - Create `~/Claude/skills/` directory
   - Claude will auto-detect new skills you add here

3. **Customize for Your Organization**
   - Edit agent files to reflect your company's terminology
   - Update command templates with your standards
   - Add company-specific skills

### Testing Your Installation

Try these commands to verify everything works:

1. **Test an Agent**
   ```
   Hey Claude, use the Product Strategy Agent to help me understand 
   the difference between TAM, SAM, and SOM.
   ```

2. **Test a Command**
   ```
   /prioritize-ai-usecases
   
   I have 3 AI projects: chatbot, code assistant, and recommendation engine
   ```

3. **Test a Skill**
   ```
   Can you show me the ai-usecase-prioritization framework details?
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Agents not appearing

**Solution:**
- Desktop: Restart Claude Desktop app
