## üÜì Free AI Tools

*For: Claude Free, ChatGPT Free, Perplexity Free, Gemini Free, and other free-tier AI chat interfaces without project/spaces capabilities*

This universal approach works across all free AI tools that don't support persistent Projects or Custom GPTs.

**Prerequisites:**
- Free account on your preferred AI platform (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, etc.)

### Installation Steps

**1. Download Repository Files**
```bash
# Option A: Git clone
git clone https://github.com/rraheja/ai-pm-tools.git

# Option B: Download ZIP
# Go to https://github.com/rraheja/ai-pm-tools
# Click "Code" ‚Üí "Download ZIP" ‚Üí Extract to local folder
```

**2. Prepare Files for Your Task**

Identify which agent(s), skills, and commands you need for your specific task:

**For strategy work:**
- Agents: Browse `/agents/` for strategy-related personas
- Commands: From `/commands/discovery-strategy/`

**For requirements/features:**
- Agents: Browse `/agents/` for execution-focused personas
- Commands: From `/commands/planning-requirements/` or `/commands/design-development/`

**For team management:**
- Agents: Browse `/agents/` for team-focused personas
- Commands: From `/commands/agile-coaching/`

**For other domains:**
- Browse `/agents/` for appropriate persona
- Browse `/commands/` for relevant templates
- Include `/skills/` files if using frameworks

**3. Use Based on Platform Capability**

### If Your Platform Supports File Upload:

**Examples:** 

1. Start a new conversation
2. Upload relevant files (agent + skill + commands as needed)
3. Set context in your first message:
   ```
   [After uploading files]

   Act as the [Agent Name] and use the uploaded command templates and skills to help me with [your specific task].
   ```

### If Your Platform Only Supports Text (No File Upload):

**Examples:** ChatGPT Free, basic AI interfaces

1. Open relevant agent/command files in a text editor
2. Copy the content
3. Paste into conversation with instructions:
   ```
   [Paste agent definition]

   Using this persona and the following template:

   [Paste command template]

   Help me with: [your specific request]
   ```

**4. Test Installation**

Try this query to verify access to uploaded/provided content:

```
What agents, skills, and command templates do you have access to from the files I've uploaded/provided?
```

**Expected:** The AI lists all agents, skills, and commands from the uploaded or pasted content.

### Example Workflows

**Strategy Session:**
```
[Upload: strategy agent file, lean canvas command]

Act as the uploaded agent persona and help me create a lean canvas for my new mobile app idea.
```

**Requirements Writing:**
```
[Upload: product manager agent file, requirements and user stories commands]

Act as the uploaded agent persona and help me write requirements for a new user authentication feature.
```

**Sprint Planning:**
```
[Upload: agile coach agent file, sprint planning command]

Act as the uploaded agent persona and help me plan our next 2-week sprint.
```

### Limitations
- No persistent knowledge base (upload/paste files each conversation)
- Limited file uploads per conversation (varies by platform)
- Need to re-establish context for each new conversation
- May require copy-paste on platforms without file upload support

### Tips for Free Tiers
- **Bookmark frequently used agents/commands** for quick access
- **Combine related files** before uploading to maximize usage
- **Start with the agent definition** to establish persona before adding commands
- **Be explicit** in referencing uploaded/pasted content to ensure it's used

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Claude Projects Issues
- **Project not accessible:** Verify subscription status, check project permissions
- **Files not uploading:** Check file size, verify Pro/Team subscription, ensure .md format
- **Agent not responding correctly:** Explicitly reference agent name in your prompt

### Claude Code Issues
- **Commands not found:** Run `/help` to verify command detection
- **Skills not working:** Check `.claude/skills/` folder structure
- **Repository not detected:** Ensure you're in the correct directory

### ChatGPT Custom GPT Issues
- **Knowledge not used:** Ensure files uploaded successfully, verify file count limit
- **Agent persona not followed:** Be more explicit: "Act as the [Agent Name]"
- **File limit reached:** Prioritize agents over commands, upload only most-used files

### NotebookLM Issues
- **Sources not uploading:** Check file format (.md supported), verify source count limit
- **Responses not using uploaded knowledge:** Explicitly mention agent or template name
- **Audio overview not generating:** Ensure sufficient sources uploaded

### Free AI Tools Issues
- **File uploads failing:** Check platform file size limits and supported formats (.md usually supported)
- **Context not maintained:** Re-upload files or copy-paste agent definitions for each conversation
- **Inconsistent responses:** Be more explicit - reference agent name and template in every query
- **Platform doesn't support files:** Use copy-paste method instead
