## 🎓 Best Practices

### Using Agents Effectively

1. **Be Specific**: Provide context about your product, market, and goals
2. **Iterate**: Start with drafts and refine based on feedback
3. **Collaborate**: Use multiple agents for complex tasks (Strategy + PM + Marketing)
4. **Document**: Save outputs in your knowledge base

### Command Tips

- Start commands with clear context
- Provide examples when possible
- Request specific formats (doc, spreadsheet, presentation)

### Integration Ideas

- **Jira/Linear**: Generate epics and stories, paste into backlog
- **Confluence/Notion**: Store PRDs, roadmaps, and strategy docs
- **Slack**: Share status reports and release notes
- **Google Drive**: Organize all generated documents
- **Figma**: Reference generated user journeys and workflows
