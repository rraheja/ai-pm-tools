# Responsible AI Framework

> **Comprehensive framework for AI governance, ethics, safety, and compliance**
> Operational guidance for implementing Responsible AI in practice

---

## High-Level Principles

### 1. Fairness
**Definition**: Equitable treatment across all user segments without bias or discrimination

**Key Practices**:
- Diverse training data representing all demographics
- Regular bias audits across protected attributes (age, gender, race, etc.)
- Fairness metrics tracked and reported
- Mitigation strategies when bias detected

**Metrics**:
- **Demographic Parity**: Equal outcomes across groups
- **Equalized Odds**: Equal false positive/negative rates
- **Disparate Impact**: Ratio of outcomes between groups (target >0.8)

---

### 2. Transparency
**Definition**: Explainable AI outputs with clear communication about capabilities and limitations

**Key Practices**:
- Model cards documenting capabilities, limitations, training data
- Explainable AI techniques (SHAP, LIME, attention visualization)
- Clear user-facing explanations of AI decisions
- Transparency reports on AI performance and incidents

**Implementation**:
- Provide citations/sources for AI-generated content
- Show confidence scores when appropriate
- Explain why certain recommendations were made
- Document model limitations in user-facing docs

---

### 3. Accountability
**Definition**: Clear ownership, governance, and responsibility for AI decisions and outcomes

**Key Practices**:
- Defined roles and responsibilities for AI systems
- Governance board with cross-functional representation
- Incident response procedures with clear escalation
- Regular audits and compliance reviews

**Structure**:
- **AI Owner**: Product leader accountable for AI system
- **Governance Board**: C-level oversight for high-risk AI
- **Ethics Officer**: Independent AI ethics review
- **Audit Team**: Internal/external compliance verification

---

### 4. Privacy
**Definition**: Data protection, user control, consent management, and regulatory compliance

**Key Practices**:
- Data minimization (collect only what's needed)
- User consent for data usage in AI
- Right to access, delete, and port data (GDPR)
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Anonymization and de-identification where possible

**Compliance**:
- **GDPR**: Right to access, deletion, portability, consent
- **CCPA**: California privacy rights
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection
- **SOC 2**: Security and privacy controls

---

### 5. Safety
**Definition**: Harm prevention, risk mitigation, robust guardrails against adverse outcomes

**Key Practices**:
- Content filtering (input and output guardrails)
- Human-in-loop for high-stakes decisions
- Fallback mechanisms when AI fails or is uncertain
- Regular safety testing (red-teaming, adversarial testing)

**Safety Mechanisms**:
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Confidence thresholds for escalation
- Emergency stop procedures
- Rollback capabilities for deployed models

---

## Operational Implementation

### Guardrails & Safety Measures

**Input Guardrails**:
- **Purpose**: Block harmful, inappropriate, or malicious user inputs
- **Methods**:
  - Keyword filtering (profanity, hate speech, illegal content)
  - LLM-based classification (harmful intent detection)
  - PII detection (prevent sensitive data leakage)
  - Prompt injection detection (security vulnerability)
- **Actions**: Block request, log incident, notify user with safe message

**Output Guardrails**:
- **Purpose**: Filter AI-generated content for safety and brand compliance
- **Methods**:
  - Toxicity detection (hate speech, offensive content)
  - Factuality checks (hallucination detection, citation validation)
  - Brand safety (ensure outputs align with company values)
  - Sensitive content filtering (NSFW, violence, etc.)
- **Actions**: Block output, regenerate with constraints, escalate to human

**Rate Limiting**:
- **Per-User Limits**: X requests per minute/hour/day
- **System-Wide Limits**: Total capacity cap to prevent infrastructure overload
- **Tiered Limits**: Higher limits for paid tiers
- **Purpose**: Prevent abuse, control costs, ensure fair resource allocation

**Human-in-the-Loop Triggers**:
- **Low Confidence**: AI uncertain (confidence <80%) → escalate to human
- **High-Stakes Decisions**: Medical, financial, legal domains → require human review
- **User Request**: Allow users to opt for human review at any time
- **Safety Violations**: Guardrail triggers → human verification before proceeding

---

### Evaluation & Testing

**Evaluation Strategy**:
- **Groundedness**: % of outputs grounded in source data (target >90%)
- **Relevance**: % of outputs addressing user query (target >85%)
- **Hallucination Rate**: % of factually incorrect statements (target <5%)
- **Bias**: Fairness metrics across demographics (disparate impact >0.8)
- **Safety**: Harmful output rate (target <0.1%)

**Testing Approaches**:

**Offline Evaluation** (Pre-Deployment):
- LLM-as-judge for quality assessment
- Human evaluation on representative sample (100-500 examples)
- Synthetic data testing for edge cases and demographics
- Adversarial testing for robustness

**Online Evaluation** (Production):
- A/B testing new models vs. baseline
- User feedback collection (thumbs up/down, ratings)
- Real-time quality metrics dashboards
- Automated hallucination detection

**Bias Testing**:
- Synthetic dataset generation with demographic variations
- Counterfactual fairness testing (change only protected attribute)
- Subgroup analysis (performance by age, gender, race, etc.)
- Regular audits (quarterly reviews of bias metrics)

---

### Bias Detection & Mitigation

**Detection Methods**:
- **Statistical Parity**: Equal positive prediction rates across groups
- **Equal Opportunity**: Equal true positive rates across groups
- **Predictive Parity**: Equal precision across groups
- **Calibration**: Equal calibration (predicted probabilities match reality)

**Mitigation Strategies**:

**Pre-Processing** (Data Level):
- Resample to balance representation
- Relabel biased data
- Add synthetic data for underrepresented groups

**In-Processing** (Model Level):
- Adversarial debiasing (remove demographic signals)
- Fairness constraints during training
- Multi-task learning with fairness objectives

**Post-Processing** (Output Level):
- Threshold adjustment per group
- Calibration adjustments
- Output filtering based on fairness checks

**Continuous Monitoring**:
- Dashboard tracking fairness metrics by demographic
- Alerts when disparate impact <0.8 or other thresholds breached
- Quarterly bias audit reports to governance board

---

### Monitoring & Observability

**Real-Time Dashboards**:

**Performance Dashboard**:
- Latency: p50, p95, p99 response times
- Throughput: Requests per second
- Error rates: 4xx, 5xx errors
- Availability: Uptime percentage

**Quality Dashboard**:
- Accuracy/relevance scores (daily averages)
- Hallucination rate (weekly tracking)
- User feedback sentiment (thumbs up/down ratio)
- Citation accuracy (% of responses with valid sources)

**Safety Dashboard**:
- Guardrail trigger frequency
- Harmful content detection rate
- Human escalation rate
- Incident counts by severity

**Compliance Dashboard**:

- Audit log completeness
- Data retention compliance
- Regulatory metric tracking (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

**Drift Detection**:

- **Concept Drift**: User needs/expectations change
- **Alerting**: Alert when drift exceeds threshold (e.g., 10% performance drop)

### Incident Response

**Severity Levels**:
- **SEV1 (Critical)**: Safety issue, data breach, complete outage
  - Response: <15 minutes, all-hands, immediate escalation to C-suite
- **SEV2 (High)**: Partial outage, significant quality degradation, compliance violation
  - Response: <1 hour, incident commander assigned, stakeholder notification
- **SEV3 (Medium)**: Minor quality issues, isolated user complaints
  - Response: <4 hours, tracked in backlog, investigated during business hours
- **SEV4 (Low)**: Cosmetic issues, single-user edge cases
  - Response: <24 hours, logged for future improvement

**Incident Response Process**:
1. **Detection**: Monitoring alert or user report
2. **Triage**: Assess severity, assign incident commander
3. **Mitigation**: Stop the harm (rollback model, disable feature)
4. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders, update status page
5. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
6. **Resolution**: Implement fix, verify effectiveness
7. **Post-Mortem**: Blameless review, document learnings, action items

**Escalation Paths**:
- SEV1 → CTO, CPO, CEO immediately
- SEV2 → Director level, legal/compliance if needed
- SEV3 → Team lead, PM
- SEV4 → On-call engineer
