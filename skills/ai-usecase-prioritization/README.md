# AI Use Case Prioritization Skill

## Execution Context
**Primary Skill:** ai-usecase-prioritization  
**Associated Commands:** /prioritize-ai-usecases  
**Category:** Discovery & Strategy

Systematic value-based framework for evaluating AI initiatives using a risk-adjusted ROI methodology.

## Quick Start

Ask Claude:
- "Prioritize these AI use cases: [list]"
- "Compare [Product/Project/Use Case A] vs [Product/Project/Use Case B] for AI investment"  
- "Create an AI portfolio prioritization analysis"

Claude will ask clarifying questions, score your initiatives using the framework, and generate a prioritized dashboard.

## What You Get

- **Objective scoring** using 7 criteria (1-3 scale each)
- **Priority ranking** with 0-100 normalized scores
- **Excel dashboard** with automatic visualizations  
- **Decision rationale** for stakeholder communication

## How It Works

The framework scores initiatives on:
- **VALUE** = Impact × Adoption × Differentiation
- **RISK** = Consequence × Probability × Cost-to-Fix
- **COST** = Cost-to-Implement

**Priority Score = VALUE / (RISK + COST)**

Higher scores = higher priority. See **SKILL.md** for complete methodology.

## Best Practices for Product Managers

- **Don't game scores** - Use judgment alongside the framework
- **Phase-appropriate scoring** - Pilot phase scores differ from scale phase
- **Update as you learn** - Reassess readiness as you gather more information
- **Framework informs, doesn't decide** - Use scores to inform decisions, not replace judgment
- **Flag strategic exceptions** - Document when strategic importance overrides scores
- **Document assumptions** - Track key assumptions behind your scoring decisions
