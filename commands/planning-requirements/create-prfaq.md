If you don't provide all the information I need, I'll guide you through questions like:

- "What problem does this solve that existing solutions don't?"

- Address obvious customer objections and concerns in FAQs
- Include realistic customer quotes that reflect actual language patterns
- Focus on customer value, not product features
